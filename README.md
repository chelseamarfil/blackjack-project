# Blackjack Project
This project simulates a Blackjack Slot Machine. 

When the program runs, it does the following:
1. Ask the user to enter the account number.
2. Ask the user to enter the amount of money he/she wants to bet.
3. The program will randomly select and show the user two cards.
4. The program will randomly select another two cards and show one card (dealer’s cards).
5. The program will show the value of user’s cards and ask if the user wants to hit, stand, or split.
